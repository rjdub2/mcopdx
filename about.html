                    Contact us when you need a Professional Pourer to represent and sell your wines at
                    a local wine shop, retailer, special event or even as fill-in support for your
                    tasting room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to fill-in pourers, Margaux can contact retailers & wine shops in the
                    Portland Metro area and coordinate wine demos on your behalf. Only a Professional
                    Pourer with knowledge of your wine will be sent to pour at select retailers & wine
                    shops. Examples include New Seasons Markets, Zupan’s, Mom & Pop Wine Shop, Wizer’s,
                    Woodstock Wine & Deli and many, many more!
