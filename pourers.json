My calling to the wine industry started with my international travels and deepened with my understanding of terroir and designated growing regions from around the world. With the presence of Midwest hospitality engraved on my soul, I have translated these abilities into my love for serving, educating, and sharing the process of wine for all patrons and connoisseurs I assist. By allowing strangers to feel comfortable, and nurtured for the duration of their experiences. My bachelor’s degree in international relations, coupled with linguistics has given me a deeper understanding of the complexities of wine. It has given me a passion for understanding the depth of culture and a love for diversity. It was during a span of time in Strasburg, France bordering Germany, where I was given the opportunity to bike across the Rhine daily. Here is where I first tasted the subtle differences between French Rieslings and German Rieslings. From that season of my life I was enthralled with the sheer intricacy of wine making and tasting.",

It prompted me to work under various sommeliers in fine dining establishments of James Beard award winning chefs. I continued to travel and taste wines from regions around the world. I have taken positions of all sorts. Bartending and serving for private V.I.P. events and special guests. I have managed restaurants, organized large scale not for profit events, and created wine education classes for a large retail establishment. I have also been a wine buyer and specialist in a high sales performance purchasing position."
