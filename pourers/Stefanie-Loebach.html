                Midwest roots and a love for Oregon, Stefanie moved to Portland in 2012. She is 
                an evolving wine professional with a vibrant curiosity for wine, food, and 
                connection. She delights in getting to know people from all around the world and 
                discovering what draws them to a place. Stefanie received the WSET Level 2 
                certification under the instruction of Mimi Martin at The Wine and Spirit Archive 
                and has her heart set on furthering her education within this industry, with hopes 
                to one day be living abroad. When sheâ€™s not slinging wine, Stefanie enjoys writing, 
                dancing, sharing a meal with friends, or lingering at home with a book.
