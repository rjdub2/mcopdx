                <p>
                    Our goal is to introduce, in a professional & educated manner, products to the consumer & spark
                    a reason to fall in love with something new! Margaux & Co. specializes in demos, particularly in
                    fine retail settings such as New Seasons Markets, Zupan's, Mom & Pop Wine Shop and other fine wine
                    shops. We are an outstanding group of sommeliers, head buyers & professionals with 5-30+ years
                    experience in the industry, specializing in consumer relations. We are dedicated to making a
                    difference in the industry. Let's change how consumers try products in a retail setting, let's share
                    our knowledge, get them excited and eager to share what they've tasted with family and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to retail support, we offer support to Local Tasting Rooms. We understand the
                    difficulties
                    of having a full-time staff on hand that is perfect to handle daily visitors but not enough to
                    handle
                    the busy holiday weekends or special events. Let us help you during those busy weekends and seasons!
                    We
                    have a team dedicated to regular tasting room support, while others are available on an as needed
                    basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We specialize in wine, but are honored to pour for anyone in the beverage industry who want their
                    product
                    to be presented in a manner that reflects their premium product. We work closely with our suppliers,
                    encourage staff training & educational hand outs to consumers. Consider us your Brand Ambassadors,
                    servicing Portland-Metro area, Willamette Valley, Salem, Corvallis & Eugene.

                        Margaux Wagenmann (Lemma) started at 21 working with her family at Lemma Wine Company. She
                        enjoyed every
                        moment and made the hard decision at 34 to focus on family. The high costs of daycare, a busy
                        traveling
                        partner led her to focus on being a Mama to her two sweet children. Of course, she couldn't sit
                        still!
                        She
                        started to offer her time to pour wines for local wineries such as Coeur de Terre, Seven of
                        Hearts &
                        ROCO.
                        She soon became so busy she started to reach out to her connections for assistance - and soon
                        found that
                        many others in the industry wanted to join in, share their love of wine! She quickly founded
                        Margaux &
                        Co.
                        on July 1, 2018 and has since branched out to support premium Domestic and Imported Wines,
                        Breweries,
                        hard

                        Colleen fell in love with wine while working as a Beverage Manager in downtown Chicago at Bar
                        Toma, one of Tony Mantuano's restaurants. She left that job to allow the time to study for the
                        Certified
                        Sommelier Exam. While studying, she applied for internships to work harvest. Which lead her to
                        packing her
                        life up with one week's notice to move to Portland. She landed at Pamplin Family Winery, in
                        2015, and
                        worked harvest as a vineyard intern and in 2017 she was a cellar intern. Previously, Colleen
                        managed
                        bars and restaurants in Chicago, including a venue in Wrigley Field. In the Portland metro area,
                        she has
                        managed beverage programs for multiple restaurants. Currently, she is part of the wine team and
                        oversees
                        bar operations as the Assistant General Manager at Nostrana & Enoteca Nostrana. Colleen is a
                        Certified Sommelier pursuing the Advanced Sommelier Certification with the Court of Master
                        Sommeliers.

                        A native Oregonian, Autumn spent her early years on the Coast, enjoying bonfire brunches on the beach, 
                        foraged chanterelles and all the bounty that this amazing state has to offer. As she grew into adulthood, 
                        she fell in love with the wines of Oregon and beyond; travel only deepened her passion and interest in 
                        wine and food. Spending time in New Zealand, Italy, France, Spain, Greece as well as throughout the US, 
                        she found she enjoyed not only drinking wine, but the experience of sharing it with people to bring a deeper 
                        meaning to the place and time. She had previously poured for local winery Youngberg Hill, sharing her 
                        enthusiasm with both visitors to the area and locals finding their new favorite bottle. Autumn lives in Portland 
                        with her husband, daughter, 2 cats and dog. She loves reading British mystery novels, baking, yoga and 
                        strengthening her French language skills.
